        <p>This page is all about things I like, or more specifically
          things that make me happy. Hopefully reading these gives you
          a glimpse into who I am as a person.</p>
        <h3>Things that make me happy: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cats!</strong> I have two cats at home and I adore them. The kitten
            in the picture below is my cat Loki. Cats are the cutest/funniest
            little things in the world</li>
        </ul>
        <div class='kitten-picture'>
          <img src='images/IMG_4735.jpg' width=300 alt='A picture of Emmas adorable
            kitten named Loki.'/>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Family and Friends!</strong> This one might seem obvious but I really
            value quality time spent with loved ones</li>
          <li><strong>Coffee!</strong> I love the taste and all the lovely effects coffee
            has on me</li>
        </ul>
        <div class='coffee-picture'>
          <img src='images/IMG_4086.jpg' width=300 alt='Emma in a Dunkin Donuts
            bathroom posing with her iced coffee.'/>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Christmas Season!</strong> I LOVE Christmas time-- the
            decorations, the music, the cozy nights by the fire and the tree--
            all of it!</li>
          <li><strong>The Beach!</strong> My family has a place in Cape May, NJ, which is my
            happiest place in the world. I love spending time there</li>
          <li><strong>Music!</strong> I love listening to most genres of music. Music helps me
            to clear my mind and brings me a lot of joy </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also really enjoy being in school and the clubs I am involved in
          here at Pitt. You can go to my <a href='experience.html'>experience</a>
          page to read more about those!</p>

## New Preview

I now have more of my website done. I definitely have more work to do, specifically content-wise, but the reason I don't have that in yet is because I don't care much for my website idea. Like I said before, an entire website about me makes me a little uncomfortable, so I've been holding back on adding the content and focusing more on the look of it. That being said, I have been having a bit of trouble figuring out how to make my website look good, specifically getting the flexboxes figured out. I am also having trouble with a color scheme (it's a lot harder than it seems). 

I know I should probably have more done with this project, but I am just now getting the hang of html and css, so I see the next few days being very productive, and I expect to make much more progress. 

## Old Preview

My preview doesn't contain much. Right now, what you see is really just a menu and header. I'm having a bit of trouble trying 
to figure out how to make a sidebar specifically, but also with how I want my website to look, and how to actually make it look 
like that. Web development is kind of harder than I thought it seemed when I was doing the tutorials. What I think I need to do 
is actually come up with some concrete ideas of how I want my website to be arranged and then work to turn that into HTML and 
CSS. It should be easier to work things out on a regular piece of paper first, and then I'll be able to visualize it better to
turn it into a website.

I also have to decide if my proposal idea is what I actually want to make my website into. I don't really like the idea of 
making an entire website about myself, and I feel like I don't have much content to actually add to it because I don't have
much experience with coding at all.

I wish I could write more in this preview file but I just feel like I haven't made enough progress to be able to write anything
meaningful. :(

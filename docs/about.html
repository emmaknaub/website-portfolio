        <h2>About Emma</h2>
        <br /><hr />
        <p>I grew up in a suburban town in Delaware County, Pennsylvania,
          about 20 minutes outside of Philadelphia. I went to a Catholic
          grade school and a Catholic high school. I am now in my second
          year at the University of Pittsburgh, which is my first time at
          a public school. While I am grateful for my education at my Catholic
          schools, living in Pittsburgh and taking classes at Pitt has opened
          me up to more diverse people and opinions, and I've learned a lot of
          things that I was unable to learn from a Catholic school.
        </p>

        <p>Aside from differing opinions that I was not exposed to in my years
          at Catholic school, there were also many classes that I did not have the
          opporunity to take since there were limited class options at my
          high school. One example is Computer Science. I came into college
          knowing nothing about Computer Science and coding because there were
          very limited opportunities to learn these things at my old schools.
          I was exposed to Computer Science in my first semester at Pitt when I
          took a class called "Special Topics in Computing and Information." Towards
          the end of the semester, Bryan Salesky, the CEO of Argo AI, came to
          talk to my class, and his talk opened up my mind to all of the
          possibilities of Computer Science. I decided to take more CS classes,
          and eventually switched my major from Math to Computer Science.</p>

        <p>I am now taking more classes for my CS major and am absolutely loving
          it. I've always loved to challenge myself mentally, and CS is a great
          way for me to continue to do that. Go to my <a href='interests.html'>
          interests</a> to learn about some other things I love.</p>
